This information is useful because gives an idea of school safety in terms of sexual harassment and sexual assault, 
as well as the schoolâ€™s responsiveness to it. This information, however, does not compare what people really want to see compared. 
For example, it compares sexual assaults reported to complaints filed. This information is fine, but it might be even more 
important to compare, for example, open cases that occurred on campus to how many on-campus cases were resolved 
(and how they were resolved). Likewise, we should be looking for a comparison between the offenses committed outside of campus that are 
still open versus how many have been resolved/dismissed.  This comparison can also easily show the total of open/closed cases, 
which makes the current display of total cases unnecessary. Rearranging this information would help paint a more accurate depiction 
for students and parents interested in this University.
